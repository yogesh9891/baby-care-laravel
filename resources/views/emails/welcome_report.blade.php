<h3>Welcome to CompassTot...!</h3>

<p>Dear {{ ucfirst($name) }}'s Parent,</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the self-assessment test and signing up for the free trial of CompassTot. We are really happy to have you onboard with us.</p>

<p>We have carefully curated age as well as developmentally appropriate activities according to the current developmental stage of {{ ucfirst($name) }}. So please do them as often as you can, if possible on a daily basis, in the suggested order of difficulty levels.</p>

<p>Please give {{ ucfirst($name) }} clear instructions, enough time and good practice, to understand & learn a particular activity and get better at it incrementally. Please make sure {{ ucfirst($name) }} has fully learnt a particular level, before moving onto the next level of difficulty of the same activity.</p>

<p>We have given you a simple & really effective way to help you keep track of {{ ucfirst($name) }}'s developmental progress, for each difficulty level of an activity. This will help you understand how far {{ ucfirst($name) }} has progressed over a period of time and if there is any particular area where you might need to focus on more. Also, if multiple family members intend to do these activities with {{ ucfirst($name) }} (for e.g., grandparents in the morning, nanny in the afternoon, parents in the evening, aunt over the weekend etc.), they can easily see the ongoing activities and the learning progress made by {{ ucfirst($name) }} in each of those activities (for e.g. currently able to catch a ball 4-5 times out of 10). This will keep everyone updated at all times and avoid any potential communication gap. </p>

<p>Always remember, the quality of learning (how well a child learns something and how well the learning is reinforced to build a stronger foundation) is as important, as the speed of learning (how much time a child takes to learn something and how many milestones a child achieves by a particular age / during a particular period), since both play an important role in determining whether the resulting neural connection that form in the brain are strong or weak. Also, the speed of learning & achieving milestones is rarely constant for a child. Sometimes a child may learn things real quick and at times, the same child may take  longer to learn things seemingly simple to us. So it's best not to rush them as well as push them too hard.</p> 

<p>And most important of it all, while doing any activity, please do not make it feel like a task that needes to be completed for the sake of it. It's crucial that you have fun with {{ ucfirst($name) }} and enjoy these activities together, since this significantly improves the learning outcomes - both the quality of learning as well as speed of learning. So please be serious about having fun...! ;)</p>

<p>We sincerely hope that you make the most of your free trial...! If there is anything that we could do to help you with that, please do let us know.</p>

<p>Best Regards & Lots of Love for {{ ucfirst($name) }},</p>

<p>Team CompassTot :)</p>
